Welcome to Victors Flash SuperHero version of the Miner Game

1.) Use your mouse by clicking anywhere in the game to trigger the event.
2.) The event is a set nuclear reactors that spawn 
3.) Any miner where the particle accelerator lands on the miner turns into the flash if the event is triggered.
These flash can pick up ores faster than the normal miner. After the second mouse click spawns in Dr. Wells;
taking the place of the black smiths helping the flash save the world by collecting ores!
4.) The new entity that is created in the game whenever a new event is triggered (.i.e a mouse click) -  this new entity is the Reverse Flash.
When spawned he is seen to be around 8 particle accelerators. The Reverse FLash is an enemy of the FLash and will do anything to help an enemy of the flash.
Therefore in the game the reverse flash turns the blobs into a donky. This donky can run faster and smash veins quicker.
